Explanation Notes
Why VARRAY?

In an e-waste center, some things come in fixed small sets — for example, the standard weight categories the center uses (Light, Medium, Heavy).
A VARRAY is perfect for this because it holds a fixed number of elements that don’t change often.

Example code (for documentation):

TYPE weight_category_varray IS VARRAY(3) OF VARCHAR2(20);
weight_categories weight_category_varray := weight_category_varray('Light', 'Medium', 'Heavy');

Why Nested Table?

The number of items received each day changes a lot.
Sometimes the center receives 3 items, sometimes 50.
This makes a Nested Table a good choice because it grows or shrinks depending on the number of items.

Example code (for documentation):

TYPE weight_list IS TABLE OF NUMBER;
daily_weights weight_list := weight_list();

Why Records?

Each e-waste item has multiple attributes:

item_id

name

category

weight

Instead of creating many separate variables, a Record stores everything in one structured form.

Example code:

TYPE item_rec IS RECORD(
  item_id   NUMBER,
  name      VARCHAR2(100),
  category  VARCHAR2(50),
  weight    NUMBER
);

Why Associative Array?

An e-waste center can collect many items.
An Associative Array lets us store an unlimited number of items and access them easily by index (1, 2, 3…).

Example code:

TYPE item_table IS TABLE OF item_rec INDEX BY PLS_INTEGER;
items item_table;

Why GOTO?

Sometimes an item is invalid — missing weight, missing category, or labeled “INVALID.”
To demonstrate PL/SQL flow control, the project uses a GOTO statement to skip invalid items and continue processing the rest.

Real systems avoid GOTO, but it is used here because the assignment requires it.

Example code:

IF r.status = 'INVALID' OR r.category IS NULL OR r.weight IS NULL THEN
  GOTO skip_item;
END IF;

<<skip_item>>
NULL;
